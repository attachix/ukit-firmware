## About
This repository contains the firmware for the ESP8266 microcontroller that is the 'big brain' in the [U:Kit sensor kit](https://github.com/attachix/ukit) project.

## Software
You will need an ESP8266 toolchain and SDK. Probably the easiest way to set one is to use a [docker container](https://github.com/attachix/docker-c9-esp8266-sdk).
Optionally you may need `npm` and `nodejs` to work with the files in the `web` folder.
